# 5. The Unix spell command is a simple spell-checker. It prints out all the words in a
# text file that are not found in a dictionary. Write and test an implementation of this,
# that takes a file name as a command-line argument.
# Note: You may want to simplify the program at first by testing with a text file that
# does not contain any punctuation. A complete version should obviously be able to
# handle normal files, with punctuation.
# Another Note: You will need a list of valid words. Linux users will already have one
# (probably in /usr/share/dict/words). It is more complicated, as usual, for
# Windows users. Happily, there are several available on GitHub.
