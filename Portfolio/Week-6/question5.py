# 5. Another way to hide a message is to include the letters that make it up within
# seemingly random text. The letters of the message might be every fifth character,
# for example. Write and test a function that does such encryption. It should
# randomly generate an interval (between 2 and 20), space the message out
# accordingly, and should fill the gaps with random letters. The function should
# return the encrypted message and the interval used.
# For example, if the message is "send cheese", the random interval is 2, and for
# clarity the random letters are not random:
# send cheese
# s e n d c h e e s e
# sxyexynxydxy cxyhxyexyexysxye

# Program to encrypt a message by spacing out the letters with random intervals
